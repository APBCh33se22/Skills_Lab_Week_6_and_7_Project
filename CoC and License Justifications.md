**License:**
We chose the MIT license because free open-source software is important to us. We have no intentions of profiting off of this project. Instead, we want this project to be available to anyone to learn from or implement into projects of their own. The MIT license also protects us from being liable for any issues caused by our application. 

**Code of Conduct:**
The Ubuntu Code of Conduct, aside from being open for public use, is extensive and effective. It covers both practical issues/applications and quandries that are idealistic in nature, such as leadership, community, and knowing one's own limits.
